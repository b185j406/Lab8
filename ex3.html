    <br> Biography

    <p>

      Doctor Darcy Lewis is a former student of political science at Culver University
      who became an intern for Erik Selvig and Jane Foster's assistant. While working
      with the scientists, Lewis came into contact with Asgard when Thor arrived
      on Earth, only to be followed by the Warriors Three, Lady Sif, and the Destroyer.
      Lewis and Foster became focused on understanding the Bifrost Bridge and when
      Thor returned to Earth, Lewis assisted him in his war against Malekith and
      the Dark Elves. Returning to school, Lewis eventually graduated with a doctorate
      in astrophysics.
